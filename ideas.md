==================================================================

Where did you spend a lot of (active, minus AFK) time, which zones?
Maybe sort zones by active time, and highlight the top 5 or so.
Might be an adjustable option too?

>Required info:

* Active time spent in zone
* AFK time spent in zone






# What stats to keep track of?


## Per zone:
* XP Gained, by source
* * Mob kill
* * quest complete
* * maybe others (gathering, exploration, more?)
* Time spent
* AFK time
* Mobs killed, of every type (2 yetis, 4 cows, 19 nagas, etc)
* * Goal to be able to tell what type, or specific mob, was killed the most
* Quests completed

## Per Continent?
* Maybe this is simply all the different Zones info combined?
* Levels gained
* time spent
* quests completed

## Dugeons
* Number completed (and which ones)
* Levels gained
* Roles played (amount of time per role, or runs per role, be able to see which one you performed the most perhaps?)
* Item rolls won (maybe discard trash drops, only boss loot?)
* Time spent
